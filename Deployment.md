Here‚Äôs how you can write a **Kubernetes Deployment** YAML based on your previous ReplicaSet example. A **Deployment** offers more advanced features over ReplicaSet‚Äîlike rolling updates, rollback, and better lifecycle management.

### ‚úÖ Sample Deployment YAML (for Nginx app in `test-ns` namespace):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app-deployment
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-app
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

### üìå Key Differences from ReplicaSet:
| Feature              | ReplicaSet            | Deployment             |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Rolling Updates      | ‚ùå Not supported       | ‚úÖ Supported             |
| Rollback             | ‚ùå Manual              | ‚úÖ Built-in via CLI      |
| Management Level     | Pod-level             | App-level (Declarative) |
| Use Case             | Rarely used directly  | Most common for apps    |

### ‚úÖ Optional: Add a Service to expose the Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-app-svc
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: web-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
```

Would you like me to:
- Add rolling update strategy to this Deployment?
- Help you test/apply this YAML?
- Generate a visual diagram for the Deployment?

Let me know how you want to proceed!
